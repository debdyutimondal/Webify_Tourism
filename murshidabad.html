From the Nawabs of the pre-British era to the Lords from England, Murshidabad has seen history from its core. 
Calling it a religious town or a monument city would mean limiting its beauty and restricting it magnificence. 
This town reminds you that no matter how forward technology has brought us, some things are best experienced on foot. 
The city will transport you to a beautiful, ancient time and give you a great sense of peace and awe.

On the northern side of the palace lies The Nizamat Imambara, built in 1847 AD by Nawab Nazim Mansoor Ali Khan Feradun Jah, 
son of Humayun Jah. The stunning mosque was built after the Imambara built by Siraj-ud-Doula got burnt down in a fire.
The mosque complex is known to be the biggest in Bengal, and maybe even India.
