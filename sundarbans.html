The Dobanki Watch Tower in the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve is one such Watch Tower which has a perennial demand among visitors and anyone who visits 
Sundarbans wants to visit the Dobanki watch Tower and canopy walk. This demand stems from the fact that many tourists come to Sundarbans with a
 premonition that they would be able to see tigers only if they visit Dobanki Watch Tower. Alas, that is not the case.
