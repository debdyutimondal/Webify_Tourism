Victoria Memorial is an iconic structure that is synonymous with the city of joy!
A sixteen-foot tall bronze statue of victory, mounted on ball bearings at the top of the memorial, 
serves to heighten the overall appeal and grandeur of the entire complex. 
Victoria Memorial is breathtaking and marvellous, especially at night, when it is illuminated.
